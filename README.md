# DSC 385 - Project 2 Linear Regression

# Modeling

## Overview

```
The goal of this project is to use linear regression modeling to explore a question about en-
vironmental health. You will need to fit linear regressions, interpret model coeÔ¨Äicients, and
diagnose model fit. The final product of this project will be a PDF report (a rendered R
Quarto file) containing your code and your results.
```
## Topic

For this project you will look at data from the **Mouse Allergen and Asthma Cohort
Study** , which was an observational study of children living in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
(The data have been perturbed slightly so that they are not the exact data from the study
but still reflect the same statistical characteristics.) The primary aim of the study was to
examine the relationship between the indoor home environment and a child‚Äôs asthma morbidity.
Participants in the study were all children aged 5‚Äì17 years with asthma and were followed by
researchers for a year. For this project, the dataset contains data from each child‚Äôs very
first visit in the study (also known as the ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù visit). A representative research paper
published from this study can be found on the Canvas web site for this course.

## Getting the Data

```
The data can be obtained from the following GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Principles-of-Data-Science/Project
You can pull the GitHub repository into RStudio as follows:
```
1. Click on File > New Project...
2. Click on ‚ÄúVersion Control‚Äù


3. Click on ‚ÄúGit‚Äù
4. Paste in the URL **https://github.com/Principles-of-Data-Science/Project2** into
    the ‚ÄúRepository URL‚Äù field
5.Type in the ‚ÄúProject directory name‚Äù if needed
6. Set the directory if you don‚Äôt want to use the default
7. Click ‚ÄúCreate Project‚Äù

## Dataset Description

The dataset for this project consists of a single CSV filemaacs.csv. In the dataset you will
find the following variables

- `id` a random string identifying a participant
- `age` age in years for the participant at the beginning of the study
- `gender` self-reported gender for the child
- `fev1` forced expiratory volumn in 1 second. This is the amount of air that the child
    could expel from their lungs in one second. It is often used as a measurement of lung
    function and lung health. Higher values of FEV1 are considered more healthy but it is
    dependent on the size of the person. The variable is measured in liters.
- `eNO` exhaled nitric oxide. This is a measure that is used to indicate the amount of
    inflammation in the lungs. Higher values indicate more inflammation. eNO is measured
    in parts per billion.
- `cough_days` the number of days in the past 2 weeks where the child experienced coughing
    or wheezing. This is a count of days and ranges from 0 to 14.
- `pm25` the level of particulate matter less than 2.5ùúám in diameter inside the home. PM2.
    is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúfine particulate matter‚Äù and is a measure of indoor air
    pollution. PM2.5 is measured inùúág/m^3.
- `no2` the level of nitrogen dioxide inside the home. Nitrogen dioxide is an indoor pollutant
    that can be produced, for example, by burning natural gas. NO2 is measured in parts
    per billion.
- `mouse` the level of mouse allergen in the child‚Äôs bed. The units of mouse allergen are not
    particularly interpretable, but higher values indicate higher amounts.
- `mouse_allergic` an indicator of whether the child is allergic to mouse allergen (‚Äúyes‚Äù)
    or not allergic (‚Äúno‚Äù). Allergic status is determined using a skin prick test.

The first few rows of the dataset are shown below.

## The Report

The text of your report will provide a narrative structure around your code and outputs
with R Quarto. Answers without supporting code will not receive credit and outputs without
comments will not receive credit either. Write full sentences to describe your findings. All code
contained in your final project document must work correctly (render early, render often)!

**The report template provided in the GitHub repository contains prompts/questions
that you will need to answer. Please follow the prompts in the template and
answer all of the questions there.**

**Formatting**

- Create the report using R Quarto knitted to a PDF file, with headers for each section
    and each question answered;
- Include comments describing your R code;
- Include any references (datasets, context), if needed.
- The final report should be no more than 20 pages including all code/graphics/output
    (the number of pages can vary greatly depending on the cleaning process).
- It is extremely important that you **select pages** when submitting on Gradescope (see
    more below). Points will be taken off if you do not select the appropriate pages for each
    question in the Gradescope outline.


## Submission of the Report to Gradescope

This project report will be submitted on Gradescope for grading. Gradescope is a tool that
enables the teaching staff to eÔ¨Äiciently grade assignments like this one according to a defined
rubric. **You will not be submitting this project on Canvas**. Anything submitted to
Canvas will be ignored.

If you have never submitted anything to the Gradescope web site, please watch this video
demonstration of how to do so.

To submit your project report, please follow these steps:

1. First render your project report into a PDF file. This can be done by either rendering
    directly to PDF in RStudio or by rendering to an HTML file and then ‚ÄúPrinting‚Äù to a
    PDF file. Either way, **you must have a PDF file to submit to Gradescope**.
2. Go to the course Canvas page and click on the ‚ÄúGradescope‚Äù link on the navigation bar
    on the left hand side.
3.When the Gradescope page loads, click on the assignment titled ‚ÄúProject 1: Exploratory
    Data Analysis‚Äù.
4.You should be prompted with a window allowing you to submit a PDF file of your
    assignment.
5.After uploading your PDF file, you will be prompted to select pages of your PDF file
    that correspond to questions in the ‚ÄúQuestion Outline‚Äù. Please make sure to do this
    carefully, as it essential for allowing us to grade your project eÔ¨Äiciently.
6.After selecting the pages, submit the assignment.

## Late Policy

As per the Syllabus, projects will not be accepted late. There are no exceptions; please do not
contact the instructor or TA to request an exception.
